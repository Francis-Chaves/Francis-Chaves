## Hi there! I am Francis Chaves (she/her)ðŸ‘‹
 Iâ€™m  a postdoctoral fellow at Colorado State University. I am a plant community ecologist and I'm interested in the relationship between community structure and composition and ecosystem functioning. 
 ðŸŒ±I am currently working on data analysis of a long-term dataset on the response of plant communities to fire and grazing at Kruger National Park in South Africa.
 Iâ€™m currently learning the best practices for reproducible science, collaboration and synthesis skill. Supper excited about it! I am looking to shift my skill more to data analysis, but also I am interested in finding ways to apply science to real world issues.
